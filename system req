Minimum:

Server: Node.js 10+
RAM: 1 GB
CPU: 1 core
Storage: 10 GB
Recommended:

Server: Node.js 12+
RAM: 2+ GB
CPU: 2+ cores
Storage: 50+ GB
The website is built using Node.js, so a Node.js server environment is required. At minimum, Node.js 10+ should be sufficient.

For RAM, at least 1 GB is needed, but 2+ GB is better for performance. The CPU should have at least 1 core, but multiple cores (2+) are recommended.

Storage can start at around 10 GB for the core website files and dependencies. But 50+ GB is ideal to allow for growth, caching, logging, and backups.

The hosting should also have HTTPS enabled, a content delivery network for fast static file delivery, and auto-scaling capabilities to handle traffic spikes. Regular backups and monitoring are also recommended best practices.

Let me know if you need any other details! I'd be happy to provide more context on hosting requirements for a site like the Bootstrap docs.


Okay, since the website also uses PHP and MySQL, here are some additional minimum and recommended requirements:

PHP:

Minimum: PHP 7.2+
Recommended: PHP 7.4+
MySQL:

Minimum: MySQL 5.6+ or MariaDB 10.1+
Recommended: MySQL 8+ or MariaDB 10.4+
For PHP, the minimum version should be 7.2 or greater, but PHP 7.4+ is recommended for better performance and security.

For the database, MySQL 5.6+ or MariaDB 10.1+ should be the minimum used. But MySQL 8+ or MariaDB 10.4+ is recommended for taking advantage of more recent features and optimizations.

The MySQL or MariaDB server should have enough RAM, CPU, and storage allocated to handle the anticipated database workload and data storage needs. Some common defaults could be:

RAM: 1 GB minimum, 4+ GB recommended
CPU: 1 core minimum, 2+ cores recommended
Storage: 10 GB minimum, 50+ GB recommended
And the following PHP extensions should be installed:

mysqli
mbstring
curl
json
xml
gd
